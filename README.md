# c Workout App
# Overview

This C++ project was created to keep track of what I workout during the week. It will add the day of the week along with the workouts done to that day. This will
be added to a txt file which will record everything typed in the program. 


The purpose for writing the program was to learn C++ in its fullest and learn how to use the classes.

# Web Pages
I have to pages in this program. 
The first program is used to run the file. It will prompt the user for its workout and the day that will be saved on the txt file.
The second page is the txt file that will have everything that the user typed in the program saved.
The third page is a class file that will focus on converting the user input into a day of the week.
